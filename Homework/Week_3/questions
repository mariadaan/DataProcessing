Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.
- The == operator is to test if two values are equal. If the values are of a different type, the operator uses automatic type
  conversion. So if one of the values is an integer and the other value is a string but contains an int, JavaScript will
  convert the string to an integer. The === operator still compares two values, but doesn't use automatic type conversion.
  This means the === operator will always return false if the values are not the same type.

Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often)
- Closure is the possibility to reference a local variable/binding. This local binding can change within a closed scope,
  so you need to access it through this scope.

Explain what higher order functions are.
- Higher order functions are functions that are able to use another function as an argument or to create a new function.
  In other words, a higher-order function does not just return a value or print something, it has broader functionality and
  it can be used to change functions, create functions and provide new types of control flow.

Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.
- A query selector selects the first element in a file that meets the condition between the braces.
  file.querySelector(".example");
